# Changelog

All notable changes to `imdhemy/google-play-billing` will be documented here.

## Versioning scheme

The first published version from The [Laravel IAP](https://github.com/imdhemy/laravel-in-app-purchases) and all first
party packages including
`imdhemy/google-play-billing` are a pre-releases. All of them have the major version of `0.x`.

Starting from version `1.x`, all published versions will have the same semantic version as of Laravel in-app purchase.

Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes. When referencing the Laravel IAP or its components from
your application or package, you should always use a version constraint such as `^1.0`, since major releases of Laravel
IAP do include breaking changes.

## Support policy

For LTS releases, starting from `Laravel IAP 1`, bug fixes provided for 2 years and security fixes are provided for 3
years. These releases provide the longest window of support and maintenance. For general releases, bug fixes are
provided for 18 months and security fixes are provided for 2 years.
